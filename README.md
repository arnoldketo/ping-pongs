1.Make 5 arrays:
(the first array has numbers from 1-100
the second array has numbers divisible by 3
the third array has numbers divisible by 5
the forth array has numbers divisible by 15
the fifth array has numbers divisible by 3 and 5)

2.Prompt the user to input a number

3.Validate the input;
  The input has to be a number
  The input has to be within the range 1-100

4.Return numbers from 1 to the user input

5.If the number is divisible by 3;
  equate to the second array
  return ping

6.If the number is divisible by 5;
  equate to the third array
  return pong

7.If the number is divisible by 15;
  equate to the fourth array
  return ping-pong

8.If the number is divisible by 3 and 5;
  equate to the fifth array
  return ping-pong

9.Clear previous inputs by the user.After steps 1-8 have been completed ask user to enter an new value. Repeat steps 1-8 where relevant.
